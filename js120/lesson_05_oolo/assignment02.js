/*  1. Textual Description of Tic Tac Toe
    TTT is a two-player board game.
    The board is a 3 x 3 grid. 
    Players take turns marking a square with a marker that IDs the player.
    Traditionally, the player that uses `X` goes first, the player that uses `O` goes second.
    The first player to mark three squares in a row wins the game.
    A 'row' can be:
      - Horizontal row
      - Vertical column
      - Either of the two diagonals.  
    There is one human player and one computer player.
    The human player always moves first.
