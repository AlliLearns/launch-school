# Functions
 - You'll often have some code that you need to execute multiple times in a program.
 - You may need to run it 2 or 3 times, or you may need to run it millions of times.
 - Regardless, you probably don't want to have to rewrite that code every time it needs to be run. 
 - Most programming languages have a feature called `procedures` that let you extract the code and run it as a separate unit.
 - JavaScript calls those procedures `functions`.
