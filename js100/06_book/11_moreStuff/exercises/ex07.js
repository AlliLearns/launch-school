// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve? 

// Lets your program fail gracefully without crashing. 
// You'll need to define how those erros are handled though.

// Their solution:
// Exception handling is a process that deals with errors 
// in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch 
// statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block 
// raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way 
// that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
