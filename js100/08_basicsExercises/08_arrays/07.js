// Predict the output of the below code.
// When you run the code, do you see what you expected? 

let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);

// It'll log false. They're stored in different memory addresses. 
// You would have to assign array2 to array1 for them to be true.
