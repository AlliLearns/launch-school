# Launch School

This is a backup for all my notes and learning associated with Launch School's web development curriculum. The `main` branch won't hold much - just an overall work log where I can track my hours and what they were spent on in one place. 

Each course will be contained in its own branch and will be named after the Launch School's name for the course. For example: the orientation course 'LS95' will be in the branch `LS95` and the JavaScript orientation course will be in `JS100`.
