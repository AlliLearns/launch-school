// After Midnight (Part 02)
// As seen in the previous exercise, the time 
// of day can be represented as the number of 
// minutes before or after midnight. If the 
// number of minutes is positive, the time is after
// midnight. If the number of minutes is negative, 
// the time is before midnight. 

// Write two functions that each take a time of day
// in 24 hour format, and return the number of minutes
// before and after midnight, respectively. Both functions
// should return a value in the range [0, 1439]. You may
// not use JavaScript's Date class methods.
