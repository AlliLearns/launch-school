// Madlibs Revised
// Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a similar program 
// in the easy exercises, but this time the requirements are a bit 
// different. Build a madlibs program that takes a test 'template' as 
// input, substitutes in a section of randomized nouns, verbs and 
// adjectives and adverbs to that text, and then returns it. 
// You can build your own lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives and 
// adverbs directly into your program. Your program should read this 
// text and, for each line, place random words of the appropriate 
// types into the text and return the result. 

// The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solution, 
// it's about choosing the structure of the text templates. Choose the right 
// way to structure your templates and this problem becomes much easier. 
// Consequently, this exercises is a bit more open-ended since the input is 
// also something you'll define for yourself. 

// function madlibs(template) {
//   // ...
// }

// // These examples use the following list of replacement texts:
// // adjectives: quick lazy sleepy noisy hungry
// // nouns: fox dog head leg tail cat
// // verbs: jumps lifts bites licks pats
// // adverbs: easily lazily noisily excitedly
// // ------

// madlibs(template1);
// // The "sleepy" brown "cat" "noisily"
// // "licks" the "sleepy" yellow
// // "dog", who "lazily" "licks" his
// // "tail" and looks around.

// madlibs(template1);
// // The "hungry" brown "cat" "lazily"
// // "licks" the "noisy" yellow
// // "dog", who "lazily" "licks" his
// // "leg" and looks around.

// madlibs(template2);      // The "fox" "bites" the "dog"'s "tail".

// madlibs(template2);      // The "cat" "pats" the "cat"'s "head".
