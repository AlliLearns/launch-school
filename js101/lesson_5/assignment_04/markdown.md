# What's Markdown? 
Markdown is a `markup language`. That is, it's a set of rules and symbols that can be used to format a text document. What do I mean by that? If you're viewing this in 'raw markdown', you likely see two bits of odd symbology already.  

The header above uses a single hash symbol (#) to mark a top-level heading. The backticks (`) around 'markup language' are used to mark an inline code snippet. 

When a markdown file is opened by something that knows how to 'render' it, you'll see the results of those symbols - Large heading text will replace (# What's Markdown?) and highlighted text with mono-space font will replace the 'markup language' in backticks. 

Looking at raw markdown can be difficult to read (especially tables, and we'll be looking at a lot of those), so let's explain how to view a rendered markdown file.

## View a Rendered Markdown File
My favorite way to look at a 'rendered' file is to use Visual Studio Code. Let me know if you want help installing it (if it isn't already installed). Open a markdown file in VSC and you'll be looking at the raw markdown. If you're on Windows, the shortcut 'CTRL+SHIFT+V' will open a preview for a rendered version. (You can also open a rendered version by right-clicking on the file in the 'file explorer' to the left of the screen and clicking 'open preview' at the top of the menu that pops up.) If you drag that file over to the side, you can see the raw and rendered versions next to one another. 

Two other ways to view markdown are in your browser (though you'll likely have to go look for an extension.) and GitHub. You'll see that GitHub and VSC render their markdown in slightly different ways - how rendered markdown ultimately looks depends on the rendering engine that's being used.
