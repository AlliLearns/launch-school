## Problem Given to Student Preparing for Interview
``` js
// Problem Description
// You are going to be given an array of integers. 
// Your job is to take that array and find an index N where 
// the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the 
// sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no 
// index that would make this happen, return -1.

// For example:
// Let's say you are given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
// Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd 
// position of the array, the sum of left side of the 
// index [1, 2, 3] and the sum of the right side of the 
// index [3, 2, 1] both equal 6.

// Another one:
// You are given the array [20, 10, -80, 10, 10, 15, 35]
// At index 0 the left side is []
// The right side is [10, -80, 10, 10, 15, 35]
// They both are equal to 0 when added. 
// (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
// Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.
